Flashcards

To use this software, you will of course need decks. 2 default ones are supplied to you, which you can edit as you need. You can use Excel, notepad, or any other software capable of editing CSV files.
Every deck must be stored as a CSV file, 2 columns, front and back. Failure to properly format your decks will result in the software not working properly.
When you open a deck, you will be shown the front of a card. Think about what the answer is, and when you are ready, click on the flip button to see the back.
If your answer was right, click the got it button. You can click the continue button to move on to the next card, whether you got it right or wrong.
The process will continue until you have gotten each card right.
